	This hook connects the early userspace environment to a Tailscale
	network to allow for remote unlocking of disks and similar
	functionality. This hook requires that networking be set up using
	another mkinitcpio module, like 'net' from mkinitcpio-nfs-utils.
	An SSH server also must come from another mkinitcpio module, like
	'dropbear' from mkinitcpio-dropbear.

	Configuration can be done in /etc/tailscale/tailscaled.conf, which is
	sourced as a busybox ash shell script.

	  tailscale_port:    argument to -port (default: 41641)
	  tailscaled_args:   other args to pass to tailscaled
	  tailscale_args:    other args to pass to tailscale up
	
	See the README for security considerations and full setup instructions.
